# 🐐🍇 Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game

A fun and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with JavaScript, designed to run in the terminal. This project was created by following the [Codédex tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-tic-tac-toe-with-javascript).

## 🎮 Gameplay

Two players take turns placing their symbols on a 3x3 grid. Instead of traditional Xs and Os, this version uses 🐐 (goat) and 🍇 (grape) for a quirky twist. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full (draw).
